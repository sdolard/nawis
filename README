Build need 
----------

1) All platform
    an access to the net is required
    Qt 4.5.x or more
    wget
    unzip

2) On Windows:
    install cygwin
      wget
      unzip
  
3) Run update.sh script

4) Run build_$YOUR_PLATFORM$_$BUILD_TYPE$
    On windows, for debug build, run "build_windows_mingw_debug.bat"
    On Mac, for release build, run "build_mac_release.sh"
    On linux, for release build, run "build_linux_release.sh"
  
   Binaries are created in . directory
  
5) Run build binary
     This will create a defaut config file 
     "nawis" for release version.
     "nawis_debug" for debug version
     Read http://wiki.github.com/sdolard/nawis/start-nawis for details
     
6) A demo web ui i available. 
     It's available on "ui" directory on root projet directory.
     You must set this web ui directory in nawis config file.
       Edit ~/.config/nawis/nawis.ini
       > server def webui=<your ui absolute path>
       Ex on my Mac:
         server def webui=/Users/sebastiend/Documents/dev/nawis/ui
     
7) By defaut, nawis is listening on 6391 http port
    Open your favorite browser on http://localhost:6391
    If you want to enable ssl, go there:http://wiki.github.com/sdolard/nawis/how-enable-ssl-using-self-signed-certificate
    http and https could not be enabled together for now (this is planned for a futur version).

8) Default auth is:
     login: admin
     pwd: admin
     
     You can change them in ~/.config/nawis/nawis.ini
     > server def admin_password=admin
     > server def admin_user=admin
     
9) Login

10)Go in preference menu
     Add a directory to serve.
     Wait time to get it managed by nawis. it could take few minutes if there is a lot of big files.
     
     Demo ui implement some api:
       - music: mp3 (only) reading thought flash
       - search
       - duplicated file
       - log
       - configuration
